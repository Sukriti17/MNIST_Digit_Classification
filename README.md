## MNIST Digit Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
This Jupyter Notebook (Digitclassification.ipynb) implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x (with libraries like NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras) Jupyter Notebook Installation Ensure you have Python 3 and relevant libraries installed. You can use tools like pip for installation: Bash pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib Use code with caution. content_copy Download the MNIST dataset manually or use libraries like tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist to load it within the notebook.

## Project Structure
The notebook is expected to contain the following sections:

1. Imports:
Import necessary libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and potentially NumPy for data manipulation.
2. Data Loading:
Load the MNIST dataset using tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist or your preferred method. This typically splits the data into training and testing sets.
3. Data Preprocessing:
Preprocess the data as required for CNNs. This might include:
 -Reshaping the images (e.g., from 28x28 pixels to a 3D tensor for channels, height, and width).
 -Normalizing pixel values (e.g., scaling to the range 0-1).
 -One-hot encoding the labels (converting integer labels to a binary vector representation).
4. Model Definition:
Define the CNN architecture using Keras' sequential model API. This involves building layers like: 
-Convolutional layers with appropriate filters, kernel sizes, and activation functions. 
-Pooling layers for downsampling. -Dropout layers for regularization (to prevent overfitting). 
-Flatten layer to convert the output of convolutional layers to a 1D vector. -Dense layers (fully-connected) for high-level feature extraction and classification. 
-Output layer with 10 units (one for each digit class) and a softmax activation for probability distribution.
5. Model Compilation:
Compile the model by specifying the loss function (categorical crossentropy for multi-class classification), optimizer (e.g., Adam), and metrics (e.g., accuracy).
6. Model Training:
Train the model on the training data with a chosen batch size and number of epochs (iterations over the entire dataset). Utilize model.fit for training. During training, you might want to: -Monitor training and validation progress (using separate validation data) to avoid overfitting. -Use techniques like early stopping to halt training if validation loss doesn't improve.
7. Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing data using model.evaluate. This provides metrics like accuracy and loss on unseen data.
8. Visualization (Optional):
You can optionally visualize the learned filters or predictions to gain insights into the model's behavior. Tools like Matplotlib or TensorFlow's visualization tools can be helpful. Running the Notebook

Open Digitclassification.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed and the MNIST dataset loaded. Run the notebook cells sequentially. The code will execute each step, build the model, train it, and evaluate its performance.

## Conclusion
This project offers a basic implementation of a CNN for MNIST digit classification. You can extend it by:

Experimenting with different hyperparameters (number of filters, kernel sizes, dropout rates, etc.) for potentially better performance. Implementing data augmentation techniques (e.g., random rotations, shifts) to increase the size and diversity of your training data. Trying out different CNN architectures (e.g., deeper models with more layers) to potentially improve classification accuracy. Exploring techniques like transfer learning for leveraging pre-trained models on larger image datasets. This project provides a foundation for understanding and applying CNNs to image classification tasks. By exploring the provided code and experimenting with variations, you can gain valuable experience in building and optimizing CNN models for various image recognition applications.

## Libraries used:
- Numpy
- Keras
- matplotlib

## Evaluation 
The model gets loss a of 0.0241 and an accuracy of 0.992 while evaluating on the test set.
